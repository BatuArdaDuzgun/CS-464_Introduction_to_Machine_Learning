place my .py files and the data .csv files in the same folder.

Then open my .py files in an Python IDE (I used PyCharm) with the pandas and numpy packages. 

I do not have any defult values which need to be writen, all are already set in the code. 

all the questions can be run by typing:

python driver_script.py

in the terminal.

The output results will be displayed in the IDE's console. You might need to close the plots as they appear if the code pauses when they appear, to resume the code.
