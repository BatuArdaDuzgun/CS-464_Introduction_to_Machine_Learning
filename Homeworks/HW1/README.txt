place my .py files and the data .csv files in the same folder.

Then open my .py files in an Python IDE (I used PyCharm) with the pandas and numpy pakge. 

I do not have any defult values which need to be writen all are already set in the code. q2 has both l1 norm and l2 norm variant which run one after other.

Each python file can be run by typing:

python q3main.py

in the terminal.

The output results will be displayed in the IDE's console.
