Place my .ipynb file and the data files in the same google drive. The data must be in the main directory of the drive. 
The trained best models are in the modles folder (they are in a folder to keep things tidy). For the code to see and read them the models folder also needs to be placed in the main directory of the google drive.

Then to re-run the code, open my .ipynb file in Google Colab. 

Then run the cells from top to bottom. 

The output results will be displayed in the IDE's console.

My answears to the questions are in text boxes in my code, however I also compiled all my plots and answears in an PDF reprot for easier reading, and added it to the zip file.

My neural networks traing print the validation and training loss and accuracy for each epoch.
My data loader prints the clusters in the data with their number of elements to see iff there is a problem with the data.
