The project is is a movie recommendation system, developed by using collaborative filtering machine learning algorithms such as K-means, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and frameworks like Multi Armed Bandit (MAB). The aim is to recommend the most suitable movies to the users by doing reinforcement learning. For the training We used the MovieLens dataset which consists of 27278 movies, 138493 users and approximately 20 million ratings.
